# Soft components

A set of **decorative** web components inspired by the neumorphism design

## Benefits

### Framework agnostic

Soft components are [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), utilising the browser's capability, the components work with (and without) any JavaScript framework.

### Easily customisable

Every component has a set of CSS variables allowing you to theme it to suit your needs.
There are also a number of attributes that can be used to give your component a different look and feel, look out for the <sc-button icon style="--sc-button-vertical-align: middle" class="ma-1"><box-icon type="solid" name="brush" color="currentColor"></box-icon></sc-button> button in the component's page to play with the CSS variables.

### Tiny size

The components are lazy-loaded only when they are used in the mark-up. This means if you only want to use 1 component of the entire set, you can still use the same set-up and the performance stays optimal.
