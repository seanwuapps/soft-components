## Neumorphism

Soft Components follow the neumorphism design concept which plays with the light and shadow of the "surface" of the user interface. This design language is pleasing to look at and provides the feel of simplicity and elegance if it is applied appropriately. 

The neumorphic design has its [limitations](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-will-not-be-a-huge-trend-in-2020-67a8c35e52cc) and should **not** be applied everywhere. Hence the Soft components is a set of *decorative* components that hopefully will help your site stand out from the crowd. 

The theme store (coming soon) will hopefully give you an idea on how these components work together with other design styles. There's plenty of good usage of neumorphism in [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search/neumorphism) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/search?search=neumorphism) if you wish to be inspired.
